	My first ever working experience is as a part timer at Fit Flop MidValley in 2018. That was my first time working and apart from my family. As a part timer, I managed to undergo as a sales girl. I knew that the function of each shoes displays as Fit Flop is a shoe company that help relieve aching feet, help alleviate back, pelvis and knee strain by realigning ground reaction force towards your core relieving areas of uncomfortable high pressure.

	My second experience is as dropshiper of Choco jar Company. The duration of me being as dropshiper was around 5month. The reason why I back off from business is because lack of commitment. I cannot manage my business properly along with my study journey so I choose the study because study comes first.
