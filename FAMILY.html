	<p> I can say that I have a big family. Started with my father, SHAHRIN BIN SAOB and my mother, NOR AZIAH BINTI KAMARUDIN. They have been married for 28 years and have 7 children together. My first sibling is my sister, the freehair one, NURUL SHAHIRAH BINTI SHAHRIN and happily married to her high school lover and has a handsome son named IAN DANISH. My second sibling is my big brother, MUHAMMAD NURSHAHRIMAN BIN SHAHRIN, who sits next to me, also happily married to his PLKN lover and waiting for their child that will delivered in June 2022. </p>

	<p>Next, my twin sibling, LUQMAN NURHAKIM AND NURSHAFIQAH. On 1 January 2022, my sister finally tied the knot with her high school lover and still has the aura of newlyweds. The brother is still sigle but not available and currently works at Klang, Selangor with my Father. Im the fifth of the sibling and under me are still have two other girls that still in finding our own path in study and career. </p>
